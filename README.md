# Project Introduction
With stock trading becoming easier and cryptocurrencies on the rise, more and more people are likely 
to engage in stock or cryptocurrency trading. As it stands now, people have to create an investment/brokerage 
account and set aside capital to actually start trading. As a result, this leads to a lot of financial risk if 
someone is na√Øve or has no experience. So **Wall Street Hero** allows people to learn important information about potential stocks, 
including price, market cap, volume, 52 week high price, etc. **Wall Street Hero** will potentially provide suggestions on whether 
a particular stock is a good buy or not. We aim to provide a simplistic UI/UX in order to help beginner investors not be overwhelmed 
by massive amounts of information in their investing journey. For example, Robinhood appeals to a younger audience due to its 
modern and simple UI/UX.
